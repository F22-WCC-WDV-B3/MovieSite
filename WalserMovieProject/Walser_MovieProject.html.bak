					<h2>Origins</h2>
					<p>Lord of the Rings was originally a trilogy of books published in the early 1950s by J.R.R. Tolkien. Since then they have been read by countless millions and are considered to be one of the most influential works of fiction in recent history. They played a massive part in the creation of the modern "High Fantasy" genre, and continue to be read and enjoyed across the world.</p>
					<p>The story has been adapted many times, and in 2001 the first live action Lord of the Rings movie was released. This trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson, received many awards and introduced the story to countless new people.</p>
