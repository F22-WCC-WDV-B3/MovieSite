		<h1>RECEPTIONIST: His office is the first door on the left.</h1>
		<h1> JACK:Thank you.</h1>
		<h1>(JACK moves away R-L. CAMERA PANS with him and TRACKS IN after him through Secretary's office to open door of ULLMAN's office - revealing ULLMAN seated at desk with SECRETARY standing beside him.)</h1>

		<h1>ULLMAN: Yes?</h1>

		<h1>ULLMAN: Oh, well - come on in Jack.</h1>

		<h1>SECRETARY: Hallo. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Susie, how do you do? </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Have any trouble finding us? </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Oh, no problem at all. I made the trip in three and a half hours. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Well, that's very good time, very good. Please sit down a minute. </h1>
		<h1>(ULLMAN points to chair cam.R. JACK sits cam.R.f.g. ULLMAN walks behind desk. )</h1>

		<h1>DANNY: Mom... </h1>
		<h1>WENDY:Yeah. </h1>
		<h1>DANNY: Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter? </h1>
		<h1>WENDY:Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun. </h1>
		<h1>DANNY:Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here. </h1>
		<h1>WENDY:Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends. </h1>
		<h1>DANNY: Yeah, I guess so. </h1>
		<h1>WENDY: What about Tony? He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet. </h1>
		<h1>(M.S. DANNY while eating sandwich wiggles forefinger of his L.hand and speaks with different voice.)</h1>
		<h1>TONY: NO, I ain't Mrs. Torrance.</h1>
		<h1>WENDY: Oh come on, Tony. Don't be silly. </h1>
		<h1>(M.S. DANNY wiggles forefinger of L.hand and speaks with different voice.) </h1>
		<h1>TONY: I don't want to go there, Mrs. Torrance. </h1>
		<h1>WENDY: Well, how come you don't want to go? </h1>
		<h1>(M.S. DANNY wiggles forefinger of L.hand and speaks with different voice.)</h1>
		<h1>TONY: I just don't. </h1>
		<h1>WENDY: Well, let's just wait and see. We're all gonna have a real good time. </h1>
		<h1>DISSOLVE TO: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL/ULLMAN'S OFFICE - DAY - M.L.S.JACK over ULLMAN seated at desk. BILL WATSON enter office.JACK rises and shakes hands with him.</h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.</h1>
		<h1>WATSON: How do you do? </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Bill, how do you do? </h1>
		<h1>WATSON: Pleased to meet you. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Pleasure to meet you. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Grab a chair Bill, and join in. </h1>
		<h1>(WATSON & JACK sit down.)</h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter. I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through. </h1>
		<h1>WATSON: Fine. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Jack is a schoolteacher. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Eh - formerly a school-teacher. </h1>
		<h1>WATSON:(OFF) What line of work are you in now? </h1>
		<h1>JACK: I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet. </h1>
		<h1>WATSON: Well this ought to be quite a change for you. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Well, I'm looking for a change. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: (OFF) Our people in Denver recommended Jack very highly, and, for once, I agree with them. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Let's see, where were we? Yes. I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: (OFF) Oh, it sure would be </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN (CONT'D)but the problem is the enormous cost it would be to keep the road to the Sidewinder open. It's a... It's a 25 mile stretch of road  gets an average of 20 feet of snow during the winter, and there's just no way to make it economically feasible to keep it clear. When the place was built in 1907, there was very little interest in winter sports, and this site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty. </h1>
		<h1>JACK:Well, it's certainly got plenty of that. </h1>
		<h1>(JACK laughs.)</h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: That's right. And did they give you any idea in Denver about what the job entails? </h1>
		<h1>JACK:Only in a very general way. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Well...</h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN (CONT'D) ...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur. And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Well, that sounds fine to me. </h1>
		<h1>(ULLMAN grunts off.) </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN Physically, it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... five months of peace is just what I want. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation... </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: (OFF) (CONT'D) can of itself be a problem. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Not for me.</h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it? </h1>
		<h1>JACK: They'll love it. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: (OFF) Great... </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Well, before I turn you over to Bill, there is one other thing I think we should talk about. I don't want to sound melodramatic, but it is something that's been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.  </h1>
		<h1>JACK: I'm intrigued. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970? </h1>
		<h1>(JACK shakes his head)</h1>
		<h1>JACK: I don't believe they did. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: (OFF) Well, my predecessor in this job hired a man named Charles Grady, as the winter caretaker. He came up here with his wife and two little girls of about eight or ten. And he had a good employment record, good references and from what I've been told, I mean, he seemed like a completely normal individual. But at some point during the winter, he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown. He ran amok and eh... killed his family with an axe, </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: (OFF) (CONT'D) stacked them neatly in one of the rooms in the West Wing, and then he um... then he put eh both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: (CONT'D) The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: (OFF) (CONT'D) shut in together over long periods of time. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Well, that is eh quite a story. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Yes, it is. Oh, it's still hard for me to believe that it actually happened here, but it did and eh... I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Ah, I certainly can, and eh... I also understand why your people in Denver left it for you to tell me. </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: Well, obviously some people can be </h1>
		<h1>ULLMAN: (OFF) (CONT'D) put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened. </h1>
		<h1>JACK: Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict. </h1>
		<h1>(Shooting through open door - DANNY standing on stool at basin.)</h1>
		<h1>DANNY: Tony, do you think Daddy will get the job? </h1>
		<h1>TONY: (OFF)  Yeah, he did. He's gonna phone  Wendy up in a few minutes to tell  her. </h1>
		<h1>(WENDY back to camera washing dishes at sink. PHONE RINGS OFF. She dries her hand and puts carton in fridge. Then moves L-R into Living Room - CAMERA PANS with her. he picks up telephone receiver. ) </h1>
		<h1>WENDY:(into phone)  Hello. </h1>

		<h1>WENDY: (over phone)  Hi, hon. How's it going? </h1>
		<h1>JACK:(into phone)  Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and  I still have an awful lot to go  through. I don't think I can get  home before nine or ten. </h1>
		<h1>(WENDY sitting on back of chair phone to ear.)</h1>
		<h1>WENDY:(into phone) Sounds like you got the job? </h1>
		<h1>(JACK leaning on reception desk with phone to ear.)</h1>
		<h1>JACK:(into phone)  Right it's a beautiful place. You  and Danny are gonna love it. </h1>
		<h1>(DANNY standing on stool by basin. He is reflected in mirror. CAMERA TRACKS IN on his reflection in mirror.)</h1>
		<h1>DANNY: Tony, why don't you want to go to  the hotel? </h1>
		<h1>(DANNY wiggles forefinger.)</h1>
		<h1>TONY: (OFF) I don't know. </h1>
		<h1>DANNY: You do too know, now come on tell me. </h1>
		<h1>(DANNY wiggles forefinger.) </h1>
		<h1>TONY: (OFF) I don't want to.</h1>
