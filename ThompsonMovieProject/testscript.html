 in that hotel for the winter? 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun. 
 <br><br><br>DANNY: 
 Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's 
 hardly anybody to play with around

 How do you do?

 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: Jack is going to take care of the 
 Overlook for this winter. I would 
 like you to take him around the 
 place as soon as we are through. 
 <br><br><br>WATSON: 
 Fine. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: Jack is a schoolteacher. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S.Jack. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Eh - formerly a school-teacher. 
 <br><br><br>WATSON: (OFF) 
 What line of work are you in now? 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 I'm a writer um... Teaching has 
 been more or less a way of making 
 ends meet. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Watson. 
 <br><br><br>WATSON: 
 Well this tought to be quite a 
 change for you. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Well, I'm looking for a change. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (OFF) 
 Our people in Denver recommended 
 <br><br><br>JACK: very highly, and, for once, I 
 agree with them. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 Let's see, where were we? Yes. I 
 was about to explain that eh... our 
 season here runs from oh May 15th 
 to October 30th and then we close 
 down completely until the following 
 May. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S.Jack.
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Do you mind if I ask why you do 
 that? It seems to me that the 
 skiing up here would be fantastic. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (OFF) 
 Oh, it sure would be 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (CONT'D) 
 but the problem is the enormous 
 cost it would be to keep the road 
 to the Sidewinder open. It's a... 
 It's a 25 mile stretch of road - 
 gets an average of 20 feet of snow 
 during the winter, and there's just 
 no way to make it economically 
 feasible to keep it clear. When 
 the place was built in 1907, there 
 was very little interest in winter 
 sports, and this site was chosen 
 for its seclusion and scenic beauty. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.L.S. Ullman over Watson & Jack. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Well, it's certainly got plenty of 
 that. 
<br><br><br>Jack laughs. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 That's right. And did they give 
 you any idea in Denver about what 
 the job entails?  
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Only in a very general way. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 Well... 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (CONT'D) 
 ...the winters can be fantastically 
 cruel, and the basic idea is 
 to...to cope with the very costly 
 damage and depreciation which can 
 occur. And this consists mainly of 
 running the boiler, heating 
 different parts of the hotel on a 
 daily rotating basis, repairing 
 damage as it occurs and doing 
 repairs, so that the elements can't 
 get a foothold. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack.
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Well, that sounds fine to me. 
<br><br><br>Ullman grunts off. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman.
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 Physically, it's not a very 
 demanding job. The only thing that 
 can get a bit trying up here during 
 the winter is eh... the tremendous 
 sense of isolation. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack.
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Well, that just happens to be 
 exactly what I'm looking for. I'm 
 eh... I'm outlining a new writing 
 project, and eh five months of peace is just what I 
 want. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 That's very good Jack, because eh... 
 for some people eh solitude and 
 isolation... 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (OFF) (CONT'D) 
 can of itself be a problem. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Not for me. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 How about your wife and son? How 
 do you think they'll take to it? 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 They'll love it. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (OFF) 
 Great... 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman.
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 Well, before I turn you over to 
 Bill, there is one other thing I 
 think we should talk about. I 
 don't want to sound melodramatic, 
 but it is something that's 
 been known to give a few people 
 second thoughts about the job. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack.
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 I'm intrigued. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 I don't suppose they eh told you 
 anything in Denver about the 
 tragedy we had up here during the 
 winter of 1970? 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack shakes his head. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 I don't believe they did. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. BILL Watson. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (OFF) 
 Well, my predecessor in this job 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (CONT'D) 
 hired a man named Charles Grady, as 
 the winter caretaker. He came up 
 here with his wife and two little 
 girls of about eight or ten. And 
 he had a good employment record, 
 good references and from what I've 
 been told, I mean, he seemed like a 
 completely normal individual. But 
 at some point during the winter, he 
 must have suffered some kind of a 
 complete mental breakdown.  
 He ran amok and eh... killed his 
 family with an axe, 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack.
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (OFF) (CONT'D) 
 stacked them neatly in one of the 
 rooms in the West Wing, and then he 
 um... then he put eh both barrels 
 of his shotgun in his mouth. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman sitting behind desk. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (CONT'D) 
 The police eh... they thought that 
 it was what the old-timers used to 
 call cabin-fever, a kind of 
 claustrophobic reaction which can 
 occur when people are 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack.
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (OFF) (CONT'D) 
 shut in together over long periods 
 of time. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Well, that is eh quite a story. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Ullman laughs. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 Yes, it is. Oh, it's still hard 
 for me to believe that it actually 
 happened here, but it did and eh... 
 I think you can appreciate why I 
 wanted to tell you about it. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Ah, I certainly can, and eh... I 
 also understand why your people in 
 Denver left it for you to tell me. 
<br><br><br>JACK: laughs. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
U.S. Ullman laughing. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 Well, obviously some people can be 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Jack. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: (OFF) (CONT'D) 
 put off by the idea of staying 
 alone in a place where something 
 like that actually happened. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen 
 with me, and eg as far as my wife 
 is concerned, I am sure she'll be 
 absolutely fascinated when I tell 
 her about it. She's a confirmed 
 ghost story and horror film addict.

 Oh I know. Kids can scare you to 
 death, but believe me these episodes 
 are not at all uncommon, and they 
 look much worse than they are. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Wendy over Doctor. 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 But eh what was the matter with him? 
 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: 
 Mrs. Torrance, most of the time 
 these episodes with kids are never 
 explained. They are brought on by 
 emotional factors, and they rarely 
 occur again. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Doctor. 
 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: 
 They're more akin to auto-hypnosis, 
 a kind of self induced trance. If 
 it re-occurs which I doubt

 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: (OFF) (CONT'D) 
 you can always think about having

<br><br><br>WENDY: holds cigarette packet out towards Doctor. 
 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: (OFF) 
 No thank you. 
She puts packet down on table. 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 Oh, I'm...I'm sure you're right. 
She lights cigarette from lighter. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Doctor. 
 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: 
 Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. 
 Torrance? 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Wendy. 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 Only about three months. Eh we're 
 from Vermont. My husband was 
 teaching school there. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Doctor 
 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: 
 Did the appearance of Danny's 
 imaginary friend...? 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Wendy over Doctor. 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: Tony. 
 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: 
 Did Tony's first appearance happen 
 to coincide with your arrival here? 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Wendy 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 No, um let's see I guess Danny 
 started talkin to Tony about the 
 time we put him into nursery school. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Doctor over Wendy. 
 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: 
 Did he adjust well to school? 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Wendy - she shakes her head. 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 No. He didn't like it too much at 
 first, and then he had an injury, 
 so we kept him out for a while, 
 and, yeah, I...I guess that's about 
 the time when I first noticed that 
 he was talking to Tony. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Doctor over Wendy. 
 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: 
 What sort of injury did he have? 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Wendy 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 Ah he dislocated his shoulder. 
<br><br><br>Wendy inhales. 
 <br><br><br>DOCTOR: (OFF) 
 How did he manage to do that? 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 Well it's just one of those things. 
 You know... purely an accident, um. 
 My husband had oh... been drinking, 
 and he came home about three hours 
 late, so he wasn't exactly in the 
 greatest mood that night. And well 
Danny had scattered some of his 
 school papers all over the room... 
 and my husband grabbed his arm, you 
 know, and pulled him away from them. 
 It's...it's just the sort of thing 
 you do a hundred times with a 
 child - you know, in a park or on 
 the streets - but on this particular 
 occasion my husband just... used 
 too much strength and he injured 
 Danny's arm. 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.S. Doctor 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: (OFF) (CONT'D) 
 Anyway, something good did come out 
 of it all because he said: 
 <br><br><br>CUT TO:
M.C.S. Wendy 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: (CONT'D) 
 "Wendy, I'm never gonna touch 
 another drop and if I do you can

 Hey, wasn't it around here that the

 I think that was farther west in 
 the Sierras. 
 <br><br><br>DANNY: 
 What was the Donner party? 
 24. 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 There were a party of settlers in 
 the covered wagon times. They got 
 snowbound one winter in the 
 mountains. They had to resort to 
 cannabilism in order to stay alive. 
 <br><br><br>DANNY: 
 You mean they ate each other up? 
 <br><br><br>JACK: 
 They had to, in order to survive. 
 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 <br><br>JACK:... 
 <br><br><br>DANNY: 
 Don't worry, Mom. I know all about

 Yes, I believe they are based

 Oh well they're really gorgeous. 
 As a matter of fact this is probably 
 the most gorgeous hotel I've ever

 it.

 31. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 I'm afraid you're not going to do 
 too well here unless you've brought 
 your own supplies. We always 
 remove all the booze from the 
 premises when we shut down: 
He points to shuttered bar. 
 <br><br><br>ULLMAN: 
 that reduces the insurance that we

 Don't let it get you down Mrs. 
 Torrance - it's big but it still

 <br><br><br>WENDY: 
 I wouldn't know what to do with it

 Well one thing for sure, you don't

 And it was three goddam years ago. 
 The little fucker had thrown all my
